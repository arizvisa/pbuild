building dependencies with paths needs to be tested
write different types of build scenarios
all variables need to be hidden when executing ./build.list

features that make supports:
    -A - make all errors non-fatal
    -C - change to directory
    -d - debugging information
    -f - use specified makefile
    -j - parallel building
    -q - question mode (1 on failure, 0 on success)

add platform independance:
    cc - c compiler
    link - linker
    asm - assembler
    chdir - switch to a directory
    rm - remove a file
    chmod - modify permissions (if supported)
    cp - copy a file
    touch - mark a file as updated
